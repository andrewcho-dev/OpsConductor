# System Health Monitoring

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system health monitoring capabilities in the OpsConductor platform.

## Health Monitoring Components

The system health monitoring includes:

- **Overall Health**: Aggregated health status of all components
- **System Health**: CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring
- **Database Health**: Connection pool, query performance, and statistics
- **Application Health**: API server, task queue, and scheduler monitoring
- **Docker Containers**: Container status and health checks
- **Services**: External services and integrations

## Health Check Implementation

Health checks are implemented with:

- Redis caching for performance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Multi-component health aggregation

## Recent Improvements

- Fixed scheduler health check by adding procps package
- Enhanced Docker container health monitoring
- Improved error handling and reporting
- Added real-time health metrics

## Health Check Configuration

Health checks are configured in:
- docker-compose.yml for container health checks
- backend/app/services/health_management_service.py for application health checks

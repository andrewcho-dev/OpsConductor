# Development Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the development practices, tools, and processes for the OpsConductor platform.

## Architecture

The OpsConductor platform uses a modern architecture with:

- **Backend**: FastAPI application with API endpoints, database models, and business logic
- **Frontend**: React application with Material-UI components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and task queuing
- **Task Queue**: Celery for background task processing
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx for SSL termination and request routing

## Development Workflow

The development workflow includes:

1. Feature planning and requirements gathering
2. Implementation in feature branches
3. Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
4. Code review and quality assurance
5. Deployment to staging and production environments

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
- **E2E Tests**: Testing complete user workflows
- **API Tests**: Testing API endpoints and responses

## Docker Infrastructure

The Docker infrastructure includes:

- PostgreSQL container for database
- Redis container for caching
- Backend container for API server
- Frontend container for web UI
- Celery worker container for background tasks
- Scheduler container for scheduled tasks
- Nginx container for reverse proxy
- Prometheus and Grafana containers for monitoring

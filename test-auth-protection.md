# Authentication Protection Test Guide

## What We Implemented

‚úÖ **Complete Route Protection System**

### 1. **Restructured App Routing**
- **Before**: Only individual routes were protected, but the outer route wrapper wasn't
- **After**: All routes except `/login` are wrapped in a top-level `ProtectedRoute`
- **Result**: Any attempt to access any page without authentication redirects to login

### 2. **Enhanced ProtectedRoute Component**
- **Authentication Check**: Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
- **Admin Protection**: Redirects to `/dashboard` if admin access required but user isn't admin
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while checking authentication
- **Debug Logging**: Console logs for troubleshooting authentication issues
- **Redirect Preservation**: Stores the originally requested URL to redirect back after login

### 3. **Smart Login Redirect**
- **Redirect Back**: After successful login, user is redirected to the page they originally tried to access
- **User Feedback**: Login screen shows which page the user was trying to access
- **Default Fallback**: If no specific page was requested, defaults to `/dashboard`

## How to Test

### Test 1: Direct URL Access (Unauthenticated)
1. **Clear browser storage** (localStorage/sessionStorage)
2. **Navigate directly** to any protected page:
   - `http://192.168.50.100/users`
   - `http://192.168.50.100/targets`
   - `http://192.168.50.100/jobs`
   - `http://192.168.50.100/dashboard`
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - Immediately redirected to `/login`
   - Login screen shows: "Please log in to access /users" (or whatever page)

### Test 2: Login and Redirect Back
1. **Try to access** `http://192.168.50.100/users` (while not logged in)
2. **Get redirected** to login screen
3. **Login successfully** with admin credentials
4. **Expected Result**: Automatically redirected back to `/users` page

### Test 3: Admin-Only Pages (Non-Admin User)
1. **Login** with a non-admin user account
2. **Try to access** admin-only pages:
   - `/users` (User Management)
   - `/system-settings`
   - `/audit`
   - `/auth-config`
3. **Expected Result**: Redirected to `/dashboard` (access denied)

### Test 4: Session Expiration
1. **Login successfully**
2. **Wait for session to expire** or manually clear `access_token` from localStorage
3. **Try to navigate** to any page or refresh
4. **Expected Result**: Redirected to login screen

## Browser Console Logs

When testing, check the browser console for helpful debug messages:

```
üîê Route Protection Check: {path: "/users", isAuthenticated: false, user: null, requireAdmin: true}
üö™ Redirecting to login - User not authenticated for /users
‚úÖ Login successful, redirecting to: /users
‚úÖ Access granted to /users
```

## Admin vs Regular User Access

### Admin User (`admin` role):
- ‚úÖ Can access all pages
- ‚úÖ User Management (`/users`)
- ‚úÖ System Settings (`/system-settings`)
- ‚úÖ Audit Dashboard (`/audit`)
- ‚úÖ Auth Configuration (`/auth-config`)

### Regular User (`user` role):
- ‚úÖ Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- ‚úÖ Targets (`/targets`)
- ‚úÖ Jobs (`/jobs`)
- ‚úÖ Monitoring pages
- ‚ùå User Management (redirected to dashboard)
- ‚ùå System Settings (redirected to dashboard)
- ‚ùå Audit Dashboard (redirected to dashboard)

## Security Features

1. **No Bypass Routes**: Every route except `/login` requires authentication
2. **Role-Based Access**: Admin-only pages properly check user role
3. **Token Validation**: Authentication state is validated on app initialization
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Invalid/expired tokens are automatically removed
5. **Session Management**: Proper session timeout and extension handling
6. **Force Logout**: API errors (401) trigger immediate logout and redirect

## Troubleshooting

If authentication isn't working:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for authentication debug logs
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify API calls are being made with Authorization headers
3. **Check localStorage**: Ensure `access_token` is present after login
4. **Check User Service**: Verify backend services are running and responding
5. **Check Nginx Logs**: Ensure proxy is forwarding requests correctly

The system now provides **complete protection** - any attempt to access the application without proper authentication will redirect to the login screen.

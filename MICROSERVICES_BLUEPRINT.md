# OpsConductor Microservices Architecture Blueprint

## 🏗️ CLEAN REBUILD STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Services
```
services/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── postgres/          # Database container
│   ├── redis/             # Cache container  
│   ├── rabbitmq/          # Message broker
│   └── api-gateway/       # Nginx reverse proxy
```

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Services  
```
services/
├── auth-service/          # JWT token management
└── user-service/          # User CRUD operations
```

### Phase 3: Core Business Services
```
services/
├── universal-targets-service/    # Target system management
├── job-management-service/       # Job creation & scheduling
└── job-execution-service/        # Job execution engine
```

### Phase 4: Frontend & Integration
```
services/
├── frontend/              # React UI
└── shared-libs/           # Common utilities
```

## 🎯 MICROSERVICES PRINCIPLES

### Service Boundaries
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service owns one business domain
- **Database Per Service**: No shared databases between services
- **API Contracts**: Well-defined REST APIs
- **Independent Deployability**: Each service can be deployed separately

### Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for request/response
- **Asynchronous**: RabbitMQ for events and job processing
- **Service Discovery**: Docker internal networking

### Data Management
- **Auth Service**: User credentials, sessions, tokens
- **User Service**: User profiles, roles, preferences  
- **Targets Service**: Target systems, connection configs
- **Job Management**: Job definitions, schedules, metadata
- **Job Execution**: Execution history, results, logs

## 🚀 BUILD ORDER

1. **Infrastructure** - Databases, Redis, RabbitMQ, API Gateway
2. **Auth Service** - Authentication foundation
3. **User Service** - User management
4. **Targets Service** - Target system management  
5. **Job Management** - Job creation and scheduling
6. **Job Execution** - Job execution engine
7. **Frontend** - User interface
8. **Integration** - End-to-end testing

Each service will be built, tested, and integrated independently.

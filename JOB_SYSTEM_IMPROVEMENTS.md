  - Daily with interval
  - Weekly with day selection
  - Monthly with day-of-month
- **Cron Expressions**: Full cron syntax support
- **Advanced Options**: Max executions, end dates, timezone support
- **Schedule Management**: View, edit, delete existing schedules

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes:
- Added `job_schedules` table for schedule configurations
- Added `schedule_executions` table for execution tracking
- Updated `Job` model with schedules relationship
- All migrations handled automatically via SQLAlchemy

### API Endpoints Added:
```
POST   /api/jobs/safety/cleanup-stale
POST   /api/jobs/safety/terminate/{job_id}
GET    /api/jobs/safety/health
POST   /api/jobs/schedules
GET    /api/jobs/{job_id}/schedules
GET    /api/jobs/schedules/{schedule_id}
PUT    /api/jobs/schedules/{schedule_id}
DELETE /api/jobs/schedules/{schedule_id}
GET    /api/jobs/schedules/due/list
```
